									<h1>Soccer Analysis: Goalscorers</h1>
								</header>
									<center><h2>Purpose</h2></center>
									<p> The intent and purpose of this project is to visualize and analyze the goalscoring ability of major football players. The data has been collected for domestic league goals scored by 55 major players. Most of these players are extremely well-known and widely considered to be successful. The project strives to analyze the importance of each league goal by the difficulty of the opponent.</p>
									<p> The source for all the information was Transfermarkt.com. Data was collected by the author through web scraping. The time span is the 2006-07 season (henceforth as the "2007 season") to the 2021-22 season (henceforth as the "2022 season"). The data was loaded on to Excel, explored through Python and transformed into visuals through Python and Tableau. </p>

								<h2><b><center>Summary of Findings</center></b></h2>
								<body>
									<ul>
										<li>72.5% of goals are scored between the ages of 24-32; the highest-scoring age is 29</li>
										<li>Age and Goals have a Normal distribution; Age and PPG (Efficiency) do not have a relationship</li>
										<li>There is no relationship between Goals and Year for each Age group (i.e. 27-year-olds do not score more goals as the years go by) </li>
										<li>Ronaldo and Messi dominate by volume; Icardi is the most efficient</li>
										<li>Aguero scores the highest proportion of his goals against Contending teams, Neymar the highest against Relegation teams</li>
										<li>Of high-volume seasons, the best are Messi 2012 and Ronaldo 2011</li>
										<li>Of low-volume seasons, the best are Forlan 2010 and Vardy 2018</li>
										<li>Of seasons which maintain high efficiencies, the standouts for volume are Di Natale 2010, Di Natale 2011 and Dzeko 2009</li>
										<li>Of seasons which maintain low efficiencies, the standouts for volume are Huntelaar 2012, Suarez 2014 and Messi 2015</li>
										<li>Rooney 2011 might be the worst 25+ goal season of them all; Messi 2015 the worst 40+ goal season (he scored 51% of his goals against Relegation teams)</li>
										<li>In general, each player has a distinct profile and skillset. Predicting how well a player plays against high-quality opposition in a particular season is practically impossible. It is possible, however, to predict when a player's peak will occur by Age: it is almost certainly in the age bracket of 24-32 with the most likely peak age being 29</li>

								<h2><b><center>Introduction</center></b></h2>
								<p> There are long-standing debates in the footballing world. Who is better - Ronaldo or Messi? Is Haaland likely to be the next Lewandowski? Was Benzema a better big-game player than Suarez? Is Lukaku a mid-table menace rather than a big-game player? The answers to some of these questions may be elucidated a bit further here. </p>
								<p> Most talented players aim to play in one of the main four leagues: La Liga (Spain), Serie A (Italy), Bundesliga (Germany) or the EPL (England). Each of these leagues follow a nearly identical structure and format: There are 20 teams per season for Italy, Spain and England; 18 for the Bundesliga. Each team plays the other teams once at home and once away, for a total of 38 games (34 for the Bundesliga). 3 points for a win, 1 for a draw, 0 for a loss. The team with the most points at the end of the season wins the league. </p>
								<p> Winning the league is considered a major achievement for players. The "Top Four leagues" listed above are considered among the highest prizes in club football. Legends and careers are made by the reputation of scoring lots of goals - but perhaps more crucially - scoring <i>important</i> goals.</p>
								<p> The importance of a goal is measured in many ways. Many of these factors are unquantifiable or just difficult to quantify - the stage of the season (early or late), the historical rivalry between the teams, the previous year's results, the moment of time in the game, the flow or momentum of the game, the health of the two teams, etc. There does exist, however, an easy method to quantify the difficulty of a goal: by the points ratio of the opponent.</p>
								<p> As mentioned earlier, each team collects points across the season. <b>3 for a win, 1 for a draw, 0 for a loss.</b> For 38-game seasons, the maximum points total is 38 x 3 = 114 (102 for Bundesliga; as of now, all points will be adjusted for the Bundesliga but continue unmentioned). Most teams don't need that many points to win the league title or are simply unable to reach such a high total. As a general rule, 70% of the points - or 80 points - are enough to be a serious contender for the title. On average, only 7.3% of teams hit this target. Of course, 80 points is no guarantee of victory as other teams can still outperform the same target. But 80 points tends to be a safe benchmark for a "Contending team".</p>
								<p> Many other good teams exist in the league. If the contenders generally compete for 1st place (with roughly 2-3 contenders per season), then other good teams often compete for the positions of 4-6, many of which come with its own benefits. Teams that have a points ratio of 50%-70% usually satisfy that status of a "Good team". Only about a quarter of teams fall into this category.</p>
								<p> Teams that collect between 35%-50% of total points tend to be considered "Mid-Table teams" which are known for their mediocrity. This is the largest category of teams, accounting for nearly half of them. Lastly, teams below the 35% cutoff tend to be "Relegation teams" in danger of being demoted to the league below.</p>
								<p> These four categories will be used henceforth to categorize the difficulty of each opponent.</p>
								<center><table>
									<thead>
										<tr>
										<th id="Categories"> Tier or Difficulty
										<th> Name
										<th> Team Points Ratio
										<th> Total Team Points (Rounded)
										<th> Total % of Teams
									</thead>
									<tbody>
										<tr>
											<td> Tier I
											<td> Contending Teams
											<td> >70%

											<td> 25.00%
									</tbody>
								</table></center>
								<p> As one can see, the categorization is quite simple and straightforward. It is purely mathematical and does not conflate highly variable factors. Ultimately, at the end of the season, no one asks about injuries or poor form or bad refereeing decisions - one simply looks at the final league position of a team to judge whether the season was satisfactory or not. This is the basis for the following analysis. </p>
								<center><h2>Calculation of Player Points</h2></center>
								<p> Players will be awarded <b>Points</b> for each goal they score. The points will be then aggregated by Player, Year, Tier, Age and any other variable that may give an insight into the data.</p>
								<p> The calculation of points is intended to be straightforward. There will exist a <b>Multiplier</b> for each goal scored. This Multiplier will depend solely on the Tier of the opponent. The purpose of this Multiplier is to highlight the differences between the difficulty of the opponents. If no Multiplier is added, then the difference between good and bad seasons become difficult to detect. Thus, the formula of <b><i>Team Ratio * Multiplier</i></b> will ultimately yield the final Points value awarded to a player for each goal.</p>
								<p> Mid-Table teams are taken as the average of the dataset - hence the Multiplier for them shall be 1. The other three Tiers shall be thinly balanced out such that there is a certain level of equity in the distribution of Multipliers.</p>

								<p><b>Example:</b> Messi has scored 8 goals this season: 1 against Madrid, 2 against Valencia, 2 against Osasuna and 3 against Mallorca. Madrid finished the season with 85 points, Valencia with 76, Osasuna with 45 and Mallorca with 27. How many points did Messi acquire this season?</p>
								<body>
									<ul>
										<li><b>Formula: Team Points/Total Possible Points * Multiplier * Number of Goals</b></li>
										<li>Madrid: 85/114 * 1.5 * 1 = 1.12</li>
										<li>Valencia: 76/114 * 1.25 * 2 = 1.67</li>
										<li>Osasuna: 45/114 * 1 * 2 = 0.79</li>
										<li>Mallorca: 27/114 * 0.75 * 3 = 0.53</li>
									</ul>
								</body>
								<p> Messi has acquired 4.11 points from 8 goals, giving him 0.51 Points-Per-Goal.</p>
								<p> <b>Choice of Players: </b>As mentioned earlier, the information was collected for the Top Four Leagues for the 16 seasons between 2007 and 2022. Players who have been included in the project have played at least 3 seasons in at least one of these leagues. Furthermore, they have tallied a minimum of 50 goals across that time period. Of course, players play for different teams and move between the leagues as well. This was not considered an evaluable factor as team changes are highly volatile from year to year and depend on a multitude of factors. Oftentimes, the same team can be drastically different in adjacent seasons. The changing of leagues, however, will hopefully be visible as an important factor in narrating the story of a player's career.</p>
								<p> 55 players were thus included in the project. Notable names are Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Robert Lewandowski, Karim Benzema, Luis Suarez and Sergio Aguero. Players who have had spontaneously proficient seasons, such as Radamel Falcao or Diego Forlan, have also been included. Players who have played for a long duration but haven't scored in high densities, such as Aritz Aduriz, have also been included. Almost all players played as forwards or wingers; Frank Lampard is the only midfielder on the list.</p>
								<center><h2>Establishment of Categories</h2></center>
								<p> Of the 55 players included, there are a total of 563 seasons played and 8176 league goals scored. Each season is marked by the total <b> Goals, </b>total <b>Points</b> and the <b>Points-Per-Goal (henceforth "PPG")</b>.</p>
								<p> The relationship between Points and Goals is a direct one. As mentioned earlier, points are awarded for goals by the formula <b><i>Team Ratio * Multiplier = Points</i></b>. As one might expect, a player who scores more goals is going to accumulate more points. The ratio isn't absolutely direct, however, as players can accumulate points at different rates. Those who score more often against high-quality opposition will accumulate points faster than those who score mostly against low-quality opposition.</p>
								<p> The Total Points can be used as a good measure of a season's success: 106 of the 563 seasons have accumulated in excess of 10 points. This accounts for roughly one-fifth (18.8%) of the collected seasons, thereby making it a healthy standard for <b>Effective Seasons</b>. Throughout an Effective Season, a player accumulates at least 10 points. This cutoff allows us to filter out the seasons where a player might have been too young, too old, prone to injuries or simply below-standard.</p>
								<p> Of these 106 Effective Seasons, nearly one-third of them (29%) are from just three players: 12 seasons by Messi, 12 by Ronaldo and 7 by Lewandowski. The lowest goal total is Diego Forlan's 2010 season with 18 goals and the highest is Lionel Messi's 2012 season with 50 goals. The highest scoring season to fall <i>outside</i> this range is Wayne Rooney's 2010 season with 26 goals (i.e. 26 goals but still less than 10 points).</p>
								<p> One would also be wise to look at the PPG ratio: it is a simple ratio of points collected per goal scored. This ratio ought to give a better insight into the particularities of each seasons. Did the player score a high volume of goals against Relegation teams and Mid-Table teams? Or did they score a low volume of goals against Contending and Good teams? This measure is likely to function better as a secondary-view of <b>Efficient Seasons</b> rather than a primary filter. Throughout an Efficient Season, a player accumulates at least 0.45 Points Per Goal (the median).</p>
								<p> We have now established the two categories we shall mentioned repeatedly throughout this project:</p>
								<body>
									<ul>
										<li><b>Effective Seasons:</b> Player has accumulated >10 points.</li>
										<li><b>Efficient Seasons:</b> Player has a PPG ratio of >0.45.</li>
									</ul>
								</body>
								<center><h2> Part I: Analysis by Age</h2></center>
								<p>The first variable we shall look at is the player's Age. In our dataset, the Age of the players spans from 19-41. The data was grouped by Age on Python and the following analysis was provided (Python code can be found on my GitHub).</p>
								<body>
									<ul>
										<li>Lowest scoring Age by total goals is 19 (5 goals)</li>
										<li>Highest scoring Age by total goals is 29 (762 goals)</li>
										<li>Most efficient Age is 38 (PPG = 0.517, N > 50)</li>
										<li>Least efficient Age is 31 (PPG = 0.728, N > 50)</li>
									</ul>
								</body>
								<center><div class="image"><img src="images/GoalsByAge.png" class="largeGraphs"/></div></center>
								<p>One can see that the almost seems to follow a Normal distribution, with a visible peak around age 29. 72.50% of total goals occur between the ages of 24-32. This age range is generally said to be the peak of an individual's physical fitness, and the data would agree with that idea. It can also be said that older players are also more experienced whereas younger players are more energetic; the range of 24-32 is likely the point in a player's career where high physical ability and high mental aptitude coincide.</p>
								<center><div class="image"><img src="images/PPGByAge.png" class="largeGraphs"/></div></center>
								<p>There are no discernable trends here; rather, the graph stays largely flat across the age groups. The peaks at 19 and 39-41 are due to a very small sample size. From the ages of 20-38, the Efficiency of the players are relatively constant. With a correlation value of 0.028 between Age and PPG, players do not seem to noticeably change in efficiency throughout their careers.</p>
								<p><b>Conclusion:</b> Age and Goals appear to have a Normal distribution: they form a large hump around the years of 24-32 with a steep drop-off on either side. Age and PPG do not have a discernable correlation.</p>
								<center><h2> Part II: Analysis by Year (with Blocking for Age)</h2></center>
								<p>As mentioned earlier, there are 16 seasons in the dataset: 2007-2022. Here we explore the change in goals by Year, along with a blocking factor for Age. </p>
								<center><div class="image"><img src="images/GoalsBySeason.png" class="largeGraphs"/></div></center>
								<p>While the graph generally seems to show a collection of goals between 2010-2018, it is important to keep in mind that the players are of a particular age group: 47 of the 55 players were born between 1980 and 1995. We had already noted that players peak around the age range of 24-32. The majority of these players enjoyed their peak between the years of 2010-2018 (Age and Year have a correlation of 0.475). But it is important to keep the factor of Age in mind. Since the Age of the player is a confounding factor, no definite conclusions can be made from this graph.</p>
								<center><div class="image"><img src="images/PPGBySeason.png" class="largeGraphs"/></div></center>
								<p>With regards to efficiency, the players do not seem to change by Year. The players in general seem to be quite consistent throughout the years.</p>
								<center><h3><b>Blocking for Age</b></h3></center>
								<p>Here we look at the relation between Year and Goals by Age blocks. Four Age blocks which have large data samples and are within the peak years of 24-32 will be looked at here.</p>
								<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Block25.png" class="blockGraphs"/></div></center>
								<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Block26.png" class="blockGraphs"/></div></center>
								<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Block27.png" class="blockGraphs"/></div></center>
								<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Block28.png" class="blockGraphs"/></div></center>
								<p>As one can see, there are no definite patterns here. It appears that, despite blocking for Age, Year and Goals still do not show any discernable relationship. Although not shown, Year and PPG also failed to show any relationship. The PPG-Year graphs (with blocking for Age) can be found on my GitHub.</p>
								<p><b>Conclusion:</b> There is no discernable relationship between either Year and Goals or Year and PPG.</p>
								<center><h2> Part III: Analysis by Volume and Difficulty</h2></center>
								<p> Here we shall look at the spread throughout the four Tiers of difficulty by volume and by proportion.</p>
								<center><h3>Volume</h3></center>
								<center><div class="image"><img src="images/MostGoals.png" class="mediumVolumeGraphs"/></div></center>
								<p> Of the 55 players included, here are the ten with the highest volume of goals. The majority of them will have their individual seasons analyzed in the following section.</p>
								<p> For those who follow soccer closely, it should not be a surprise to see Ronaldo and Messi at the very top. The voluminal difference between Messi-Lewandowski (2nd-3rd) is more than the difference between Lewandowski-Kane (3rd-10th). It must also be noted that most players are within 2 percentage points of the median PPG of 0.45. The two exceptions are Immobile (-3%) and Dzeko (+3%). This likely suggests that 0.43-0.47 is the expected range of efficiency sustainable at high volumes. Discrepancies may occur in individual seasons but are unlikely across entire careers.</p>
								<center><div class="image"><img src="images/MostPoints.png" class="mediumVolumeGraphs"/></div></center>
								<p> When ordered by total points, the list has only one major player change: Immobile is replaced by Di Natale. Otherwise, Higuain-Suarez and Benzema-Dzeko swap places.</p>
								<center><div class="image"><img src="images/HighestPPG.png" class="mediumVolumeGraphs"/></div></center>
								<p> As mentioned earlier, it appears that the ideal range of efficiency for high volume is 0.43-0.47. Most of the players with high efficiencies also have lower volumes. This likely suggests that it is difficult to maintain a high efficiency across high-volume seasons. One must necessarily acquire a high-volume by scoring a lot against Mid-Table and Relegation teams in the first place (who jointly represent 68% of an average league). This will naturally bring the efficiency down. In this context, Dzeko appears to be the only outlier who has succeeded in maintaining a high-volume and high-efficiency.</p>
								<center><div class="image"><img src="images/LowestPPG.png" class="mediumVolumeGraphs"/></div></center>
								<p> Here we find the players who are the least efficient. Lampard, our sole midfielder and chief penalty taker, is present here. Immobile and Bale both have the stereotype of being "mid-table menaces" - implying that they both score largely against mediocre, Mid-Table teams. It would seem that the stereotype is largely correct. In the case of Bale, however, the point must be made that he played a large part of his career (2014-2018) with Ronaldo. During those seasons, Ronaldo was the primary goalscorer and most likely to score in big-games. Hence it may be argued that Bale's role in big-games was different: he had to support Ronaldo and couldn't afford to take selfish shots at goal.</p>
								<p> The presence of Rooney as Manchested United's highest goalscorer appears odd but can be justified in a similar line of reasoning as Bale: Rooney often had to play second-fiddle to better goalscorers in big-games (Ronaldo & Van Persie) and couldn't afford to be as selfish.</p>
								<center><h3>Difficulty</h3></center>
								<center><h3>Contending & Good Teams</h3></center>
								<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Tier1ByTotal.png" class="smallVolumeGraphs"/></div></center>
								<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Tier2ByTotal.png" class="smallVolumeGraphs"/></div></center>
								<p> Against Contending teams, we expected to find both Ronaldo and Messi due to their massive volume of goals. Aguero also shows up with his penchant for performance. Against Good teams, the dominance of Ronaldo and Messi becomes more visible. Other players may match the pair with goals against Contending teams, but to sustain that level of motivation and performance against Good teams seems to be more difficult. It is possible that this is a psychological phenomenon: perhaps Icardi can motivate himself to play very well against Contending teams, but that same motivation doesn't arrive for Good teams. The touch can be sloppy, the positioning can be lazy, the passes can be haphazard - none of these would likely occur as frequently if the mental acuity was turned up. Perhaps the dominance of Ronaldo and Messi is not merely one of talent and longevity - it is about the mental drive for performance as well.</p>
								<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Tier1ByPer.png" class="smallPerGraphs"/></div></center>
								<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Tier2ByPer.png" class="smallPerGraphs"/></div></center>
								<p> We see once again that Aguero dominates the proportions against Contending teams. Ribery and Vardy both obtain their high efficiencies by goals against Good teams. Ribery actually scores more often against Good teams than he does against Mid-Table teams (remember that Mid-Table teams are 43% of the league on average, whereas Good teams are only 24%).</p>
								<center><h3>Mid-Table & Relegation Teams</h3></center>
								<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Tier3ByTotal.png" class="smallVolumeGraphs"/></div></center>
								<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Tier4ByTotal.png" class="smallVolumeGraphs"/></div></center>
								<p> Once again, there is nothing surprising here: high-volume scorers tend to beat down on mediocre and poorer teams the most.</p>
								<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Tier3ByPer.png" class="smallPerGraphs"/></div></center>
								<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Tier4ByPer.png" class="smallPerGraphs"/></div></center>
								<p> Here we see that Huntelaar scores a whopping 69% of his goals against Mid-Table opponents whereas Neymar tops the list for highest proportion against Relegation teams.</p>
								<p><b> Conclusion:</b> Ronaldo and Messi dominate the volume charts by Tier. Aguero scores the highest proportion of his total goals against Contending teams, Ribery against Good teams, Huntelaar against Mid-Table teams and Neymar against Relegation teams.</p>
								<center><h2> Part IV: Analysis of Efficiency By Volume</h2></center>
								<p> The relationship between PPG and Goals by Season can be seen below:</p>
								<center><div class="image"><img src="images/PPGByGoals.png" class="largeGraphs"/></div></center>
								<p> The erratic behavior at the lower and higher ends can be explained by a small sample size at the higher and lower aggregates. Barring these discrepancies at the extremes, the efficiency of a season cannot be deduced by the volume of goals. At the higher end, it is evident that some players can score 40+ goals with high efficiency while others score the same amount with low efficiency.</p>
								<p><b> Conclusion: </b>There is no direct correlation between PPG and Goals in a Season, although exceptions can certainly occur.</p>
								<center><h2> Part V: Analysis of Efficiency & Effectiveness By Season</h2></center>
								<p>Here, we shall take a deeper look at the particular natures of the seasons involved. The seasons of the players will be grouped off into five categories:</p>
								<body>
									<ul>
										<li>Low Volume, Effective Seasons</li>
										<li>High Volume, Effective Seasons</li>
										<li>High Efficiency & High Volume, Effective Seasons</li>
										<li>Low Efficiency & High Volume, Effective Seasons</li>
										<li>High Volume, Ineffective Seasons</li>
									</ul>
								</body>
								<p>As mentioned in the beginning, an <b>Effective Season</b> is a season where a player has accumulated more than 10 points. This cutoff is meant to isolate the truly excellent seasons from the rest. 18.8% of the seasons are considered Effective. An <b>Efficient Season</b> has a PPG above 0.45 (the median).</p>
								<center><h3> Part A: Low Volume, Effective Seasons</h3></center>

								</table></center>
									<p> Here we analyze the relation between Volume and Effectiveness. Naturally, as players accumulate more goals, they will also accumulate more points. The two factors have a very high correlation of 0.97 as points are quite literally awarded for goals scored.</p>
									<p> Let us analyze the <b>Low Volume, Effective Seasons</b> first. In order for a season to be Effective with a low volume, it would imply that the player has scored disproportionately against high-quality competition. Scoring against high-quality competition is generally very good, but these seasons are imbalanced with a high proportion of goals against high-quality teams. In 2010, Forlan scored 4 goals against Contending Teams, 4 goals against Good Teams, and only 10 goals came against Mid-Table or Relegation opponents. Aguero (1, 6), Muller (2, 4), Negredo (2, 4), and Vardy (2, 9) all had similar success against Contending and Good teams in these respective seasons, but all seemed to likewise be dry against low-quality teams.</p>
									<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Forlan2010.png"/></div></center>
									<p> Let us compare these seasons to their total proportions.</p>
									<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Tiers1.png"/></div></center>
									<p> At first glance of <b> total output</b>, Muller appears to be the odd one out: whereas Aguero, Forlan, Negredo and Vardy all score about 4-6% of their total goals against Contending Teams, Muller scores only 1.46% of his goals against the best of the best. But this discrepancy can likely be explained by the hegemonic nature of the Bundesliga. Bayern, where Muller plays, overwhelmingly tends to be the only Contending Team. Across the 16 seasons between 2007 and 2022 in this study, Bayern was the Contending Team upon 12 occasions; Dortmund was the only other Contending Team, with only 4 seasons of contention. This means that Muller had, quite literally, only 2011, 2012, 2016 and 2019 as opportunities to play against a fellow Contending Team (only 8 games across 16 seasons). His lack of goals against Contending opponents can be explained by a lack of opportunity rather than a lack of performance.</p>
									<br>
									<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Tiers2.png"/></div></center>
									<p> Once broken down by season, one sees that the five seasons of <b>Low Volume, High Effectiveness</b> all have similar percentage spreads. Aguero 2008 had 36.84% of goals againts Contending and Good teams; Forlan 2010 had 44.44%, Muller 2016 and Negredo 2011 had 30.00%, and Vardy 2018 had 55.00%. This seems only natural as the low threshold of 10 points demands a high proportion of goals against Contending and Good teams. </p>
									<p> In essence, despite their total low volume of goals, the five seasons of Forlan 2010, Aguero 2008, Muller 2016, Negredo 2011 and Vardy 2018 are disproportionately overrepresented by goals against high-quality opponents. The players scored between 30-55% of their goals against Contending and Good Teams, whereas Contending and Good teams compose on average only 31.73% of a given league. Given that Contending and Good Teams are much likelier to have good defenses and concede less goals, it is quite surprising to see a one-to-one ratio for any given season. Vardy's 2018 rate of 55% against Contending and Good Teams seems almost astronomical in comparison.</p>

									<p> For <b>High Volume, Effective Seasons</b>, the approach to analysis must be different. Since the correlation between Points and Goals is a direct one (i.e. points are literally awarded for goals), one can expect that high-volume goals will yield high-point seasons. The analysis has to do more with the distribution of goals to see how players compare at the very highest level.</p>
									<p> We have - perhaps unsurprisingly - 7 of 10 seasons dominated by Messi (4) and Ronaldo (3). Lewandowski, Suarez and Immobile also contribute an individual season each. Let us briefly take a look at their <i>total</i> goal proportions across 2007-2022. </p>
									<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Tiers3.png"/></div></center>
									<p> The difference between four of the five players is not particularly stark. Lewandowski (54.49%) scores a much higher proportion of his goals against Mid-Table opposition than the others. Suarez and Immobile, on the other hand, score a very large chunk of their goals (about 38% each) against Relegation opponents. But the remainder of the proportions are relatively close.</p>
									<p> The odd one out by volume, however, is Immobile. His 187 total goals are a far cry from Suarez (245), Lewandowski (312), Messi (463) and Ronaldo (476). But he appears to be far better at scoring against Contending and Relegation Teams while being far worse at scoring against Good Teams. He seems to be overrepresented at the very top and the very bottom. </p>
									<p> Being overrepresented at the very bottom is not strange for a striker who is frankly several levels below the other four players on the list. But his quality against Contending teams feel strange - if he performs so well against Contending teams, why does he not also perform well against Good teams? A closer look reveals that Immobile scored 10 goals against Contending Teams.</p>
									<center><div class="image"><img src="images/ImmobileContending.png"/></div></center>
									<p> Transfermarkt reveals that 40% (4/10) of these goals were penalties. Penalties are, naturally, much easier to score and are most frequently caused by fouls or handballs. Although being a prolific penalty taker is indeed an important skill, the act of winning a penalty is often highly determined by luck. </p>
									<p> In comparison with the other four players against Contending opponents, Suarez's penalty ratio for goals against Contending teams is 0% (0/7), Lewandowski 0% (0/7), Messi 25% (3/12) and Ronaldo 29% (4/14). Immobile's high penalty ratio against Contending teams as a lone-striker may be explained by a multitude of factors: his team's general inferior quality leading to counter-attacking opportunities in which penalty fouls are more likely to occur, his penchant for theatrics and diving, or perhaps an actual gameplan used by managers of Lazio. Regardless, his penalty ratio is the highest against Contending opponents of the five players, thereby explaining why he is an outlier among them.</p>
									<p> Now let us begin to compare the average for each of these players with their individual seasons.</p>
									<p><b>Messi 2012: </b></p>
									<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Messi2012.png"/></div></center> 
									<center><div class="image"><img src="images/TiersMessi1.png"/></div></center>
									<p>A glance at Messi's seasons reveals the spread of the goals. His record-breaking 2012 season, which saw him score an astonishing 50 goals in 37 games, was heavily concentrated around Mid-Table opposition. An additional 10 goals in 4 games against Good Teams rounds off the effort. The entire season was a show of excellence.</p>
									<p><b>Messi 2015: </b></p>
									<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Messi2015.png"/></div></center>
									<p>This season saw more than half of his goals being scored against Relegation opponents (22/43). This makes his 2015 season appear to be far less impressive in comparison with the remaining three. If we were to use the PPG as a comparing factor, his 2015 season ranks as 0.39 points-per-goal, where as the other three are noticeably higher (0.45 for 2012, 0.46 for 2013 and 0.49 for 2017). This can be used to argue, of course, that Messi's 2015 season was a stat-stuffing season against very low-calibre teams.</p>
									<p> Now let us look similarly at Ronaldo.</p>
									<p><b>Ronaldo 2012:</b></p>
									<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Ronaldo2012.png"/></div></center> 
									<center><div class="image"><img src="images/TiersRonaldo1.png"/></div></center>
									<p> Ronaldo's 2012 season bears a great deal of similarity with Messi's 2012 season: a beating down of the mediocre teams in the league. Likewise, his 2015 season is also an overrepresentation of goals against Relegation opponents.</p>
									<p><b>Ronaldo 2011: </b></p>
									<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Ronaldo2011.png"/></div></center>
									<p>In contrast to the other two seasons on this list, Ronaldo 2011 was one of the best league-seasons in modern history. Goals came pouring down on high-quality teams. The only contender that season (besides Ronaldo's Madrid) was Barcelona: his sole penalty in the second half of the season is Ronaldo 2011's only goal against a contender. But his record against Good Teams is remarkable: 15 goals in 8 games against Villarreal, Sevilla, Valencia and Bilbao. Relegation opponents accounted for only 4 of Ronaldo's goals this season: 36 goals (90% of the total) were against Mid-Table teams or higher.</p>

									<p> Acquiring a <b>High Efficiency</b> is quite straightforward: one must be more likely to score against high-quality competition than against low-quality competition. These seasons tend to be very lop-sided with the player scoring in a number of big games. In essence, these players have the ability to motive themselves and bring in performances when the stakes are at the very highest.</p>
									<p> We have already taken a look at Vardy 2018 and Forlan 2010 earlier. Both of these seasons were looked at because they were <b>Low Volume</b> seasons, but one can see that they are also <b>High Efficiency</b> seasons. It is perhaps easier to keep a high efficiency when volume is low - after all, the goals against high-quality competition weigh proportionally more than goals against low-quality competition. But what if the volume of goals increase? Wouldn't the goals naturally come against low-quality competition, thereby diluting and lowering the PPG ratio? That would be the natural assumption. But there are some seasons where players break that logic and manage to maintain a high volume <i>and</i> a high efficiency - an impressive achievement. Here we will take a look at a couple of such seasons.</p>
									<p><b>Dzeko 2009:</b></p>
									<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Dzeko2009.png"/></div></center>
									<p> We see that Dzeko 2009 was a rather discreetly efficient season. Excellent performances against Good teams has led to Dzeko having an overall PPG of 0.58 for the season. This high PPG was kept up despite the total of 26 goals, which shows that Dzeko was able to maintain a solid consistency year-round. We see a similar trend for Di Natale 2010 & 2011, which were both seasons which maintained both a high Efficiency and a high Volume.</p>
									<p><b>Di Natale 2010 & 2011:</b></p>
									<center><div class="image"><img src="images/DiNatale2010and2011.png"/></div></center>
									<p>The reasons for these three seasons maintaining high efficiency and high volume are unclear. It is not obvious from the data why these seasons in particular were such outliers. It is important to keep in mind that certain factors are unquantifiable determinators of the outcome: for example, if Dzeko's manager is very good at playing against good teams but struggles against bad teams (yes, such managers exist), then it is conceivable that Dzeko 2009 would be so consistently good against elite competition. Likewise, if a team coincidentally players higher-quality teams in October and November, and Di Natale is the only healthy forward on his team during those two months, then it is conceivable that many of the opportunities and goals would gravitate around him. These are just hypotheticals but their purpose is to demonstrate the factors which may go into determining these outcomes but are unidentifiable from the data.</p>
									<p>As of right now, however, we cannot chalk up the cause of excellence of these three seasons to any factor in particular.</p>

									<p>Here we have the seasons where players scored a high volume of goals but largely against low-quality competition (i.e. low efficiency). Many of these seasons have two characteristics: lots of goals against Mid-Table and Relegation teams and a paucity of goals against Contending and Good teams. The simultaneity of the two factors results in a low PPG ratio. These seasons can be safely said to be stat-stuffing seasons against low-quality competition. We have already examined Messi 2015, so let us take a look at some other examples.</p>
									<p><b>Suarez 2014:</b></p>
									<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Suarez2014.png"/></div></center>
									<p>Despite the great clamor, Suarez 2014 stands out as an odd season. Those who watched him live will know that it was an amazing display of individual willpower and creativity. He almost single-handedly willed Liverpool to the title, barring the inevitable and penultimate collapse. But Suarez's goals came largely against inferior opponents: namely, the Relegation teams of the league. This was likely due to changes in role. It is possible that Suarez was playing more of a creative role against high-quality teams whereas he took on more goal-scoring burdens against the low-quality teams. This might have been a conscious decision by the manager. Nevertheless, the season ranks as a lop-sided one where much of the goals came against the bottom half of the league.</p>
									<p><b>Immobile:</b></p>
									<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Immobile2018and2022.png"/></div></center>
									<p>It was previously mentioned that Immobile largely scores against low-quality opposition. Here are two high-scoring seasons of his which further illustrate the remark. Immobile was Serie A's top-scorer for both 2018 and 2022.</p>

									<p>Lastly, we have the <b>High Volume, Ineffective</b> seasons. We have previously been looking solely at Effective seasons (total points are greater than 10). Here we have seasons which are, in a sense, even worse: they did not even accumulate 10 points, despite the high amount of goals. These seasons are even less efficient than the ones previously examined. Note that the PPG for Rooney 2010 (0.34) and Messi 2020 (0.37) is far lower than the median of the dataset (0.45). Compare also the Messi 2020 season with Messi 2017 - one of which was significantly better than the other.</p>

								<center><h2>Conclusion</h2></center>
									<p>The purpose of this project was the illustrate the differences between high-scoring seasons. Seasons were initially looked at on the basis of Age and Year (with blocking factor for Age). Points were awarded to goals by the difficulty of the opponent. Two measures were concocted: <b>Effective Seasons</b> (seasons with 10+ total points) and <b>Efficient Seasons</b> (seasons with a points-per-goal ratio above 0.45). Five categories of seasons were looked at:</p>
									<body>
										<ul>
											<li>Low Volume, Effective Seasons</li>
											<li>High Volume, Effective Seasons</li>
											<li>High Efficiency & High Volume, Effective Seasons</li>
											<li>Low Efficiency & High Volume, Effective Seasons</li>
											<li>High Volume, Inffective Seasons</li>
										</ul>
									</body>
									<p>Various seasons were looked at closely. Justifications were given for the results and brief explanations of the season and player itself. More analysis from this dataset may follow in the future.</p>
