									<h1>Football/Soccer Goalscorers Analysis</h1>
								</header>
									<p> The intent and purpose of this project is to visualize and analyze the goalscoring ability of major football players. The data has been collected for domestic league goals scored by 55 major players. Most of these players are extremely well-known and widely considered to be successful. The project strives to analyze the importance of each league goal by the difficulty of the opponent.</p>
									<p> The source for all the information was Transfermarkt.com. The time span is the 2006-07 season (henceforth as the "2007 season") to the 2021-22 season (henceforth as the "2022 season"). </p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Lewandowski.jpg"/></div>
								<p> There are long-standing debates in the footballing world. Who is better - Ronaldo or Messi? Is Haaland likely to be the next Lewandowski? Was Benzema a better big-game player than Suarez? Is Lukaku a mid-table menace rather than a big-game player? The answers to some of these questions may be elucidated a bit further here. </p>
								<p> <b>Introduction: </b>Most talented players aim to play in one of the main four leagues: La Liga (Spain), Serie A (Italy), Bundesliga (Germany) or the EPL (England). Each of these leagues follow a nearly identical structure and format: There are 20 teams per season for Italy, Spain and England; 18 for the Bundesliga. Each team plays the other teams once at home and once away, for a total of 38 games (34 for the Bundesliga). 3 points for a win, 1 for a draw, 0 for a loss. The team with the most points at the end of the season wins the league. </p>
								<p> Winning the league is considered a major achievement for players. The "Top Four leagues" listed above are considered among the highest prizes in club football. Legends and careers are made by the reputation of scoring lots of goals - but perhaps more crucially - scoring <i>important</i> goals.</p>
								<p> The importance of a goal is measured in many ways. The stage of the season (early or late), the historical rivalry between the teams, the previous year's results, the moment of time in the game, the flow or momentum of the game, the health of the two teams, etc. Many of these are either unquantifiable or difficult to quantify. There does exist, however, an easy method to quantify the difficulty of a goal: by the points ratio of the opponent.</p>
								<p> As mentioned earlier, each team collects points across the season. <b>3 for a win, 1 for a draw, 0 for a loss.</b> For 38-game seasons, the maximum points total is 38 x 3 = 114 (102 for Bundesliga; as of now, all points will be adjusted for the Bundesliga but continue unmentioned for brevity's sake). Most teams don't need that many points to win the league title or are simply unable to reach such a high total. As a general rule, 70% of the points (80+ points) are enough to be a serious contender for the title. On average, only 7.3% of teams hit this target. Of course, 80 points is no guarantee of victory as other teams can still outperform the same target. But 80 points tends to be a safe benchmark for a "serious contender".</p>
								<p> Many other good teams exist in the league. If the contenders generally compete for 1st place (with roughly 2-3 contenders per season), then other good teams often compete for the positions of 4-6, many of which come with its own benefits. Teams that have a points ratio of 50%-70% usually satisfy that status of a "good team". Only about a quarter of teams fall into this category.</p>
								<p> Teams that collect between 35%-50% of total points tend to be considered "mid-table teams" which are known for their mediocrity. This is the largest category of teams, accounting for nearly half of them. Lastly, teams below the 35% cutoff tend to be "relegation teams" in danger of being demoted to the league below.</p>
								<p> These four categories will be used henceforth to categorize the difficulty of each opponent.</p>
								<table>
									<thead>
										<tr>
										<th id="Categories"> Tier or Difficulty
										<th> Name
										<th> Points Ratio
										<th> Points Total (Rounded)
										<th> Total % of Teams
									</thead>
									<tbody>
										<tr>
											<td> Tier I
											<td> Contending Teams
											<td> >70%
											<td> >80
											<td> 7.3%
										<tr>
											<td> Tier II

											<td> Tier III
											<td> Mid-Table Teams
											<td> 35%-50%
											<td> 40-57

										<tr>
											<td> Tier IV
											<td> Relegation Teams
											<td> <35%
											<td> <40
											<td> 25.00%
									</tbody>
								</table>
								<p> As one can see, the categorization is quite simple and straightforward. It is purely mathematical and does not conflate highly variable factors. Ultimately, at the end of the season, no one asks about injuries or poor form or bad refereeing decisions - one simply looks at the final league position of a team to judge whether the season was satisfactory or not. This is the basis for the following analysis. </p>
								<p> <b>Choice of Players: </b>As mentioned earlier, the information was collected for the Top Four Leagues for the 16 seasons between 2007 and 2022. Players who have been included in the project have played at least 3 seasons in at least one of these leagues. Furthermore, they have tallied a minimum of 50 goals across that time period. Of course, players play for different teams and move between the leagues as well. This was not considered an evaluable factor as team changes are highly volatile from year to year and depend on a multitude of factors. Oftentimes, the same team can be drastically different in adjacent seasons. The changing of leagues, however, will hopefully be visible as an important factor in narrating the story of a player's career.</p>
								<p> 55 players were thus included in the project. Notable names are Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Robert Lewandowski, Karim Benzema, Luis Suarez and Sergio Aguero. Players who have had spontaneously proficient seasons, such as Radamel Falcao or Diego Forlan, have also been included. Players who have played for a long duration but haven't scored in high densities, such as Aritz Aduriz, have also been included. Almost all players played as forwards or wingers; Frank Lampard is the only midfielder on the list.</p>
								<p> <b>Preliminary Analysis: </b>Of the 55 players included, there are a total of 563 seasons played and 8176 league goals scored. Each season is marked by the accumulated points and a measure of Points Per Goal (henceforth "PPG"). The total points can be used as a good measure of a season's success: 106 of the seasons have accumulated in excess of 10 points. This accounts for roughly one-fifth (18.8%) of the collected seasons, thereby making it a healthy standard for <b>Effective Seasons</b>. Throughout an Effective Season, a player accumulates at least 10 points.</p>
								<p> Of these 106 Effective Seasons, nearly one-third of them (29%) are from just three players: 12 seasons by Messi, 12 by Ronaldo and 7 by Lewandowski. The lowest goal total is Diego Forlan's 2010 season with 18 goals and the highest is Lionel Messi's 2012 season with 50 goals. The highest scoring season to fall <i>outside</i> this range is Wayne Rooney's 2010 season with 26 goals.</p>
								<p> One would also be wise to look at the PPG ratio: it is a simple ratio of points collected per goal scored. This ratio ought to give a better insight into the particularities of each seasons. Did the player accumulate his points from high volume goals against Relegation teams and Mid-Table teams? Or did they score low volume goals against Contending and Good teams? This measure is likely to function better as a secondary-view of <b>Efficient Seasons</b> rather than a primary filter. Throughout an Efficient Season, a player accumulates at least 0.45 Points Per Goal (the median).</p>
								<center><h2> Part I: Low Volume, Effective Seasons</h2></center>
									<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Graph2.png"/></div></center>
									<p> Here we analyze the relation between volume and effectiveness. Naturally, as players accumulate more goals, they will also accumulate more points. The two factors have a very high correlation of 0.97 (with Player Names and Year being held constant) as points are quite literally awarded for goals scored.</p>
									<p> Let us analyze the <b>Low Volume, Effective Seasons</b> first. In order for a season to be Effective with a low volume, it would imply that the player has scored disproportionately against elite competition. In 2010, Forlan scored 4 goals against Contending Teams, 4 goals against Good Teams, and the remaining 10 came against Mid-Table or Relegation opponents. Aguero (1, 6), Muller (2, 4), Negredo (2, 4), and Vardy (2, 9) all had similar success against Contending and Good teams in these respective seasons.</p>
									<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Forlan2010.png"/></div></center>
									<p> Let us compare these seasons to their total proportions.</p>
									<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Tiers1.png"/></div></center>
									<p> At first glance of <b> total output</b>, Muller appears to be the odd one out: whereas Aguero, Forlan, Negredo and Vardy all score about 4-6% of their total goals against Contending Teams, Muller scores only 1.46% of his goals against the best of the best. But this discrepancy can likely be explained by the hegemonic nature of the Bundesliga. Bayern, where Muller plays, overwhelmingly tends to be the only Contending Team. Across the 16 seasons between 2007 and 2022 in this study, Bayern was the Contending Team upon 12 occasions; Dortmund was the only other Contending Team, with only 4 seasons of contention. This means that Muller had, quite literally, only 2011, 2012, 2016 and 2019 as opportunities to play against a fellow Contending Team (only 8 games across 16 seasons). His lack of goals against Contending opponents can be explained by a lack of opportunity rather than a lack of performance.</p>
									<br>
									<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Tiers2.png"/></div></center>
									<p> Once broken down by season, one sees that the five seasons of <b>Low Volume, High Effectiveness</b> all have similar percentage spreads. Aguero 2008 had 36.84% of goals againts Contending and Good teams; Forlan 2010 had 44.44%, Muller 2016 and Negredo 2011 had 30.00%, and Vardy 2018 had 55.00%. This seems only natural as the low threshold of 10 points demands a high proportion of goals against Contending and Good teams. </p>
									<p> In essence, despite their total low volume of goals, the five seasons of Forlan 2010, Aguero 2008, Muller 2016, Negredo 2011 and Vardy 2018 are disproportionately overrepresented by goals against high-quality opponents. The players scored between 30-55% of their goals against Contending and Good Teams, whereas Contending and Good teams compose on average only 31.73% of a given league. Given that Contending and Good Teams are much likelier to have good defenses and concede less goals, it is quite surprising to see a one-to-one ratio for any given season. Vardy's 2018 rate of 55% against Contending and Good Teams seems almost astronomical in comparison.</p>
									<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Vardy2018.png"/></div></center>
									<br>
								<center><h2> Part II: High Volume, Effective Seasons</h2></center>
									<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Graph1.png"/></div></center>
									<p> For <b>High Volume, Effective Seasons</b>, the approach to analysis must be different. Since the correlation between Points and Goals is a direct one (i.e. points are literally awarded for goals), one can expect that high-volume goals will yield high-point seasons. The analysis has to do more with the distribution of goals to see how players compare at the very highest level.</p>
									<p> We have - perhaps unsurprisingly - 7 of 10 seasons dominated by Messi (4) and Ronaldo (3). Lewandowski, Suarez and Immobile also contribute an individual season each. Let us briefly take a look at their <i>total</i> goal proportions across 2007-2022. </p>
									<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Tiers3.png"/></div></center>
									<p> The difference between four of the five players is not particularly broad. The only major difference seems to be that Lewandowski (54.49%) scores a much higher proportion of his goals against Mid-Table opposition than Suarez (38.78%). Suarez and Immobile, on the other hand, score a very large chunk of their goals (about 38% each) against Relegation opponents.</p>
									<p> The odd one out is Immobile. His 187 total goals are a far cry from Suarez (245), Lewandowski (312), Messi (463) and Ronaldo (476). But he appears to be far better at scoring against Contending and Relegation Teams while being far worse at scoring against Good Teams. He seems to be overrepresented at the very top and the very bottom. </p>
									<p> Being overrepresented at the very bottom is not strange for a striker who is frankly several levels below the other four players on the list. But his quality against Contending teams feel strange - if he performs so well against Contending teams, why does not not also perform well against Good teams? A closer look reveals that Immobile scored 10 goals against Contending Teams.</p>
									<center><div class="image"><img src="images/ImmobileContending.png"/></div></center>
									<p>40% (4/10) of these goals were penalties. Penalties are, naturally, much easier to score and are most frequently caused by fouls or handballs. Although being a prolific penalty taker is indeed an important skill, the act of winning a penalty is often highly determined by luck. </p>
									<p>In comparison with the other four players against Contending opponents, Suarez's penalty ratio for goals against Contending teams is 0% (0/7), Lewandowski 0% (0/7), Messi 25% (3/12) and Ronaldo 29% (4/14). Immobile's high penalty ratio against Contending teams as a lone-striker may be explained by a multitude of factors: his team's general inferior quality leading to counter-attacking opportunities in which penalty fouls are more likely to occur, his penchant for theatrics and diving, or perhaps an actual gameplan used by managers of Lazio. Regardless, his penalty ratio is the highest against Contending opponents of the five players, thereby explaining why he is an outlier among them.</p>
									<p>Below are the goal spreads of the remaining four players against Contending Teams.</p>
									<center><div class="image"><img src="images/SuarezContending.png"/></div></center>
									<center><div class="image"><img src="images/LewandowskiContending.png"/></div></center>
									<center><div class="image"><img src="images/MessiContending.png"/></div></center>
									<center><div class="image"><img src="images/RonaldoContending.png"/></div></center>
									<p> Now let us begin to compare the average for each of these players with their individual seasons.</p>
									<center><div class="image"><img src="images/TiersMessi1.png"/></div></center>
									<p><b>Messi 2012: </b></p>
									<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Messi2012.png"/></div></center> 
									<p>A glance at Messi's seasons reveals the spread of the goals. His record-breaking 2012 season, which saw him score an astonishing 50 goals in 37 games, was heavily concentrated around Mid-Table opposition. An additional 10 goals in 4 games against Good Teams rounds off the effort. The entire season was a show of excellence. When compared to his 2013 and 2017 seasons, however, we can see that goals against Contending teams was lacking.</p>
									<p><b>Messi 2015: </b></p>
									<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Messi2015.png"/></div></center>
									<p>This season saw more than half of his goals being scored against Relegation opponents (22/43). This makes his 2015 season appear to be far less impressive in comparison with the remaining three. If we were to use the PPG as a comparing factor, his 2015 season ranks as 0.39 points-per-goal, where as the other three are noticeably higher (0.45 for 2012, 0.46 for 2013 and 0.49 for 2017). This can be used to argue, of course, that Messi's 2015 season was a stat-stuffing season against very low-calibre teams.</p>
									<p> Now let us look similarly at Ronaldo.</p>
									<center><div class="image"><img src="images/TiersRonaldo1.png"/></div></center>
									<p> Ronaldo's 2012 season bears a great deal of similarity with Messi's 2012 season: a beating down of the mediocre teams in the league. Likewise, his 2015 season is also an overrepresentation of goals against Relegation opponents.</p>
									<p><b>Explanation of Messi & Ronaldo's 2012 campaign:</b> The 2012 campaign features a high proportion of goals from both players against Mid-Table opposition. The mean percentage of Mid-Table teams in La Liga is 47.8% (9.56 teams out of 20) with a standard deviation of 10.16%. In 2012, there were 14 Mid-Table teams (70% of total), which is 2.18 standard deviations higher than the mean. For Mid-Table goals, Ronaldo's average is 49.16% with a standard deviation of 13.89% - thereby his 2012 season represents 2.41 standard deviations above his average. Messi's average of 46.65% and his standard deviation of 15.85% also yields a relatively proportionate increase of 1.60 standard deviations in 2012.</p>
									<p><b>Explanation of Messi & Ronaldo's 2015 campaign:</b> A similar analysis for the Relegation opponents shows that Messi (1.65) and Ronaldo (1.75) have a standard deviation in 2015 just barely over the league's overrepresentation of Relegation teams (1.58). Again, their increase in ratio can be explained by an increase in the league's ratio of opponents.</p>
									<p><b>Ronaldo 2011: </b></p>
									<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Ronaldo2011.png"/></div></center>
									<p>In contrast to the other two seasons on this list, Ronaldo 2011 was one of the best league-seasons in modern history. Goals came pouring down on high-quality teams. The only contender that season (besides Ronaldo's Madrid) was Barcelona: his sole penalty in the second half of the season is Ronaldo 2011's only goal against a contender. But his record against Good Teams is remarkable: 15 goals in 8 games against Villarreal, Sevilla, Valencia and Bilbao. Relegation opponents accounted for only 4 of Ronaldo's goals this season: 36 goals (90% of the total) were against Mid-Table teams or higher.</p>
									<br>
								<center><h2> Part III: High Efficiency & High Volume, Effective Seasons</h2></center>
									<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Graph4.png"/></div></center>
									<p> Acquiring a <b>High Efficiency</b> is quite straightforward: one must be more likely to score against elite competition than against poorer competition. These seasons tend to be very lop-sided with the player scoring in a number of big games. In essence, these players have the ability to motive themselves and bring in performances when the stakes are at the very highest.</p>
									<p> We have already taken a look at Vardy 2018 and Forlan 2010 earlier. Both of these seasons were looked at because they were <b>Low Volume</b> seasons, but one can see that they are also <b>High Efficiency</b> seasons. It is perhaps easier to keep a high Efficiency when Volume is low - after all, the goals against elite competition weigh proportionally more than goals against poorer competition. But what if the volume of goals increase? Wouldn't the goals naturally come against poorer competition, thereby diluting and lowering the PPG ratio? There are some seasons where players are able to have a high volume <i>and</i> a high efficiency - an impressive achievement. Here we will take a look at a couple of such seasons.</p>
									<p><b>Dzeko 2009:</b></p>
									<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Dzeko2009.png"/></div></center>
									<p> We see that Dzeko 2009 was a rather discreetly efficient season. Excellent performances against Good teams has led to Dzeko having an overall PPG of 0.58 for the season. This high PPG was kept up despite the total of 26 goals, which shows that Dzeko was able to maintain a solid consistency year-round. We see a similar trend for Di Natale 2010, which was another season which maintained both a high Efficiency and a high Volume.</p>
									<p><b>Di Natale 2010:</b></p>
									<center><div class="image"><img src="images/DiNatale2010.png"/></div></center>
									<br>
								<center><h2> Part IV: Low Efficiency & High Volume, Effective Seasons</h2></center>
									<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Graph5.png"/></div></center>
									<p>Here we have the seasons where players scored a high Volume of goals but largely against poorer competition (i.e. low Efficiency). Many of these seasons have two characteristics: lots of goals against Mid-Table and Relegation teams and a paucity of goals against Contending and Good teams. The simultaneity of the two factors results in a low PPG ratio. These seasons can be safely said to be stat-stuffing seasons against low-quality opposition. We have already examined Messi 2015, so let us take a look at some other examples.</p>
									<p><b>Huntelaar 2012:</b></p>
									<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Huntelaar2012.png"/></div></center>
									<p>Once again, Huntelaar 2012 was a hammering of average teams with little to no output against quality opposition. Against the two contending teams of the season - Bayern and Dortmund - Huntelaar's Schalke lost all four games by a combined scoreline of 8-1. The sole Schalke goal came by Jefferson Farfan. The two Huntelaar goals against Leverkusen were from the same game, which also means that Huntelaar failed to score in the other 7 games against Good teams during the season.</p>
									<p><b>Suarez 2014:</b></p>
									<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Suarez2014.png"/></div></center>
									<p>Despite the great clamor, Suarez 2014 stands out as an odd season. Those who watched him live will know that it was an amazing display of individual willpower and creativity. He almost single-handedly willed Liverpool to the title, barring the inevitable and penultimate collapse. But Suarez's goals came largely against inferior opponents: namely, the Relegation teams of the league. This was likely due to changes in role. It is possible that Suarez was playing more of a creative role against elite teams whereas he took on more goal-scoring burdens against the poorer teams. Nevertheless, the season ranks as a lop-sided one where much of the goals came against the bottom half of the league.</p>
									<p><b>Immobile:</b></p>
									<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Immobile2018and2022.png"/></div></center>
									<p>It was previously mentioned that Immobile largely scores against poorer opposition. Here are two high-scoring seasons of his which further illustrate the remark. Immobile was Serie A's top-scorer for both 2018 and 2022.</p>
									<br>
								<center><h2> Part V: High Volume, Ineffective Seasons</h2></center>
									<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Graph6.png"/></div></center>
									<p>Lastly, we have the <b>High Volume, Ineffective</b> seasons. We have previously been looking solely at Effective seasons (total points are greater than 10). Here we have seasons which are, in a sense, even worse: they did not even accumulate 10 points, despite the high amount of goals. These seasons are even less Efficient than the ones previously examined. Note that the PPG for Rooney 2010 (0.34) and Messi 2020 (0.37) is far lower than the median of the dataset (0.45). Compare also the Messi 2020 season with Messi 2017 - one of which was significantly better than the other.</p>
									<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Rooney2010.png"/></div></center>
									<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Messi2020.png"/></div></center>
									<p>In comparison with Messi 2020, here is Messi 2017 (a far better season) below:</p>
									<center><div class="image"><img src="images/Messi2017.png"/></div></center>
									<br>
								<center><h2>Conclusion</h2></center>
									<p>The purpose of this project was the illustrate the differences between high-scoring seasons. Points were awarded to goals by the difficulty of the opponent. Two measures were concocted: <b>Effective Seasons</b> (seasons with 10+ total points) and <b>Efficient Seasons</b> (seasons with a points-per-goal ratio above 0.45). Five categories of seasons were looked at:</p>
									<body>
										<ul>
											<li>Low Volume, Effective Seasons</li>
											<li>High Volume, Effective Seasons</li>
											<li>High Efficiency & High Volume, Effective Seasons</li>
											<li>Low Efficiency & High Volume, Effective Seasons</li>
											<li>High Volume, Inffective Seasons</li>
										</ul>
									</body>
									<p>Various seasons were looked at closely. Justifications were given for the results and brief explanations of the season and player itself. More analysis from this dataset shall follow in the future.</p>
